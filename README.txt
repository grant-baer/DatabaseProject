    Organized assortment of relational databases consisting of 9 separate databases (Airlines, Bakery, Cars, CSU,
    Inn, Katzenjammer [band], Marathon, Students, Wine). Each database file has set-up file, to create
    relational tables, build files for each table, to fill each table with data, test files, to observe the
    updated table, and clean up table, to clear the tables from memory. Each file should be ran in that order. 

    Update:
    Included a modify file to some of the databases to edit relational tables post creation.
